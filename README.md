- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheBatManj. People ask who my favourite superhero is and I tell them it's anyone of them where I can add a j to the end. Batmanj, Spidermanj, Wonderwomanj.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning some code, doing little bits in HTML, CSS and JS. I'm also a recruiter (I know) and hoping to find engineers who want to solve real problems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS and HTML.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... here is fine!

<!---
TheBatManj/TheBatManj is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm going to work on this over the next few months!
